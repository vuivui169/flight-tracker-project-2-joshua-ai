# flightTracker-JoshuaN-AiN-only-

<!-- Joshua N. 
This time, I added 2 features to the website by... 
1 Mode switch of the website. 
    Desc: he website will change color by its mode by clicking the switch.
    Html: added frame and buttons for switches. 
    Css: added color and size settings for background, font color, switch  itself, buttons for btoh modes.
    Javascript: Used EventListener method to switch around modes by clicking.

2 Table sorting to the website.
    Desc: users can sort the list of flight schedule alphabetically in Departure Time by clicking "Sort button.
    Html: added id's to few classes and buttons to initiate the function.
    Css: -
    Javascript: Added the code so that once the "Sort" button is clicked, list will be sorted by comparing the top row with the next row one by one.

What I learned: 
    1 Actual practice of adding multi features into a single website. 
    2 Availability to call function from Html.
    3 Usage of for loop and while loop coding for sorting the table.

Conclusion: Due to time contrainsts, I could not work for adding sorting features on all columns but the first column only.
